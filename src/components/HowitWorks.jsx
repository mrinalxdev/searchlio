      <h1>How It Works</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to our platform! Here iss a quick breakdown of how it works:
      </p>

      <p>
        Privacy-first search engines prioritize user anonymity by minimizing
        data collection and avoiding tracking. They ensure secure browsing
        without targeted advertising or personal data leaks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Companies collect user data through search engines using tracking
        cookies and search logs, creating profiles for targeted ads while
        raising privacy concerns.
      </p>

      <p>
        To address privacy concerns, companies should use privacy-focused tools,
        enhance transparency, give users control over their data, ensure
        regulatory compliance, practice data minimization, and conduct regular
        audits.
      </p>
